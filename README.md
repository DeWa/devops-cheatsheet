# Devops-Cheatsheet

List of cheatsheets related to dev-ops

## Why?

After creating the same cheatsheets over and over again after initializing new server, I decided that it's easier to gather all the cheatsheets into one repository.

## Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:DeWaster/devops-cheatsheet.git
```

## Cheatsheets

None :(

## Contributing

If you see an error or want to, please open an issue on this project or send me an email. You can also send ideas for new cheatsheet, but since this is mainly targeted for my own use I probably won't add unrelated guides. But you can always fork this repo :)
